## Introduction

Working with video datasets, particularly with respect to detection of AI-based fake objects, is very challenging due to proper frame selection and face detection. To approach this challenge from R, one can make use of capabilities offered by OpenCV, `magick`, and `keras`.

Our approach consists of the following consequent steps:

- read all the videos
- capture and extract images from the videos
- detect faces from the extracted images
- crop the faces
- build an image classification model with Keras

OpenCV is a computer vision library that includes:

- Facial recognition technology
- [Motion tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_tracking)
- [Augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality)
- and more.

On the other hand, `magick` is the open-source image-processing library that will help to read and extract useful features from video datasets:

- Read video files
- Extracts images per second of video
- Crop the faces from the images

Before we go into a detailed explanation, readers should know that there is no need to copy-paste code chunks. Because at the end of the post one can find a link to Google Colab with GPU acceleration. This kernel allows everyone to run and reproduce the same results.


## Data exploration

[The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview/description) that we are going to analyze is provided by AWS, Facebook, Microsoft, the Partnership on AIâ€™s Media Integrity Steering Committee, and various academics.

It contains both real and AI-generated fake videos. The total size is over 470 GB. However, the sample 4 GB dataset is separately available.

## Frame extraction

The videos in the folders are in the format of _mp4_ and have various lengths. Our task is to determine the number of images to capture per second of a video. We usually took 1-3 fps for every video.

> Note: Set fps to NULL if you want to extract all frames.

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
video = magick::image_read_video("aagfhgtpmv.mp4",fps = 2)
vid_1 = video[[1]]
vid_1 = magick::image_read(vid_1) %>% image_resize('1000x1000')
```

<center>

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, layout="l-body", fig.cap = "[Deepfake detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data)"}
knitr::include_graphics("files/frame_1.jpg")
```

</center>

We saw just the first frame. What about the rest of them?

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, layout="l-body", fig.cap = "[Deepfake detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data)"}
knitr::include_graphics("files/self.gif")
```


Looking at the gif one can observe that some fakes are very easy to differentiate, but a small fraction looks pretty realistic. This is another challenge during data preparation.

## Face detection

We can read all the files or take a sample. And afterward, detect and extract faces. 

There is a very well-known library OpenCV^[[Opencv](https://opencv.org/)] which is designed for computer vision tasks. R has also some bindings to OpenCV, so extracting faces will not be a challenge for us.

At first, face locations need to be determined via bounding boxes with Opencv and then with magick library automatically extracted from all of the images.

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
# get face location and calculate bounding box
library(opencv)
unconf <- ocv_read('frame_1.jpg')
faces <- ocv_face(unconf)
facemask <- ocv_facemask(unconf)
df = attr(facemask, 'faces')
rectX = (df$x - df$radius) 
rectY = (df$y - df$radius)
x = (df$x + df$radius) 
y = (df$y + df$radius)

# draw with red dashed line the box
imh  = image_draw(image_read('frame_1.jpg'))
rect(rectX, rectY, x, y, border = "red", 
     lty = "dashed", lwd = 2)
dev.off()

```

<center>

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, layout="l-body", fig.cap = "[Deepfake detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data)"}
knitr::include_graphics("files/frame_2.jpg")
```

</center>

## Face extraction

If face locations are found, then it is very easy to extract them all. 

```{r eval=F, echo=T}
edited = image_crop(imh, "49x49+66+34")
edited = image_crop(imh, paste(x-rectX+1,'x',x-rectX+1,'+',rectX, '+',rectY,sep = ''))
edited
```

<center>

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, layout="l-body", fig.cap = "[Deepfake detection challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data)"}
knitr::include_graphics("files/frame_1_face.png")
```

</center>
 
 
## Deep learning model

After dataset preparation, it is time to build a deep learning model with Keras. We can quickly place all the images into folders and, using image generators, feed faces to a pre-trained Keras model. 

```{r eval=F,echo=T}
train_dir = 'fakes_reals'
width = 150L
height = 150L
epochs = 10

train_datagen = image_data_generator(
  rescale = 1/255,
  rotation_range = 40,
  width_shift_range = 0.2,
  height_shift_range = 0.2,
  shear_range = 0.2,
  zoom_range = 0.2,
  horizontal_flip = TRUE,
  fill_mode = "nearest",
  validation_split=0.2
)


train_generator <- flow_images_from_directory(
  train_dir,                  
  train_datagen,             
  target_size = c(width,height), 
  batch_size = 10,
  class_mode = "binary"
)

# Build the model ---------------------------------------------------------

conv_base <- application_vgg16(
  weights = "imagenet",
  include_top = FALSE,
  input_shape = c(width, height, 3)
)

model <- keras_model_sequential() %>% 
  conv_base %>% 
  layer_flatten() %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = "relu") %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 1, activation = "sigmoid")

model %>% compile(
  loss = "binary_crossentropy",
  optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(lr = 2e-5),
  metrics = c("accuracy")
)

history <- model %>% fit_generator(
  train_generator,
  steps_per_epoch = ceiling(train_generator$samples/train_generator$batch_size),
  epochs = 10
)
```

## Conclusion

This post shows how the R community can work with video data and bring a solution to video classification task:

- Read videos and extract images from the dataset
- Apply OpenCV to detect faces
- Extract faces via bounding boxes
- Build a deep learning model 

However, readers should know that the implementation of the following steps may drastically improve model performance:

- extract of all of the frames from video files
- upload different pre-trained weights from Keras library
- use another technology to detect faces -- ["MTCNN face detector"](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn)

Feel free to try these options on the Deepfake detection challenge and share your results in the comment section!
