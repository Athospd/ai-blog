Why the new name, *RStudio AI Blog*? There is a straightforward reason. The
previous title, "TensorFlow for R Blog", used to be a good match for the content
we've been covering so far: Mainly, technical or applied aspects of doing deep
learning with TensorFlow and Keras. But our team (the *Multiverse Team*) is not
working exclusively in those areas; instead, enabling distributed computing from
R ([sparklyr](https://github.com/sparklyr/sparklyr)), integrating automated
machine learning workflows ([mlflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow)), and
optimizing data ingestion ([pins](https://github.com/rstudio/pins)) are
substantial aspects of what we do. So, we'd like to have a platform we can use
to tell you about our work in these areas, as well. Secondly, regarding the
hitherto dominant topic on this blog, *deep learning*, we might want to more
frequently reflect about it in a less technical way, focussing on impacts on
society, ethics, or even "just" epistemic questions.

So we needed a new name, but why "AI"? Maybe "data science" would work as well;
however, the *science* in data science brings up connotations of formality and
theoretic ambitions we'd rather avoid. Instead, *AI* seemed like a good choice,
understood as outlined in an [article by Michael
Jordan](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/wot7mkc1). Jordan envisions AI as a
new *engineering* discipline that builds on existing knowledge about inference,
optimization, computation, and data processing the way that chemical engineering
and civil engineering built upon chemistry and physics, respectively.
Supplementing those building blocks (from mathematics, statistics, computer
science), this new discipline is to include guidance from the social sciences
and the humanities.
