We very much appreciate contributions to the RStudio AI Blog from the broader R
community. If you are interested in publishing some of your own work or
insights, we'd love to hear from you!

Articles posted on the RStudio AI Blog are authored using [Distill for R
Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill). Here are the steps required to
contribute a new article:

1.  Create a [GitHub
    repository](http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html) to host your
    article (we'll use the repository for feedback and review of the post before
    it's published).

2.  Create a new [distill article](https://rstudio.github.io/distill) and check it
    into the GitHub repository (be sure to check in the the Rmd source code and
    the generated HTML files).

3.  Be sure that you've included all required [article metadata](#) (see below
    for details).

4.  [Post an issue](https://github.com/rstudio/tensorflow-blog/issues) on the
    RStudio AI Blog GitHub repo requesting that we accept your article (be sure
    to include a link back to your article's GitHub repo!).

Once we see your issue we'll take a look at your article, suggest changes as
necessary, then publish it when it's ready.

### Article metadata

To be included in the blog, your article should include some standard metadata
fields. Here's an example of a post that includes all required metadata:
