      <title>So, how come we can use TensorFlow from R?</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-08-29-using-tf-from-r</link>
      <description>Have you ever wondered why you can call TensorFlow - mostly known as a Python framework - from R? If not - that's how it should be, as the R packages keras and tensorflow aim to make this process as transparent as possible to the user. But for them to be those helpful genies, someone else first has to tame the Python.</description>

      <title>Modeling censored data with tfprobability</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-07-31-censored-data</link>
      <description>In this post we use tfprobability, the R interface to TensorFlow Probability, to model censored data. Again, the exposition is inspired by the treatment of this topic in Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking. Instead of cute cats though, we model immaterial entities from the cold world of technology: This post explores durations of CRAN package checks, a dataset that comes with Max Kuhn's parsnip.</description>

      <title>TensorFlow feature columns: Transforming your data recipes-style</title>
      <dc:creator>Daniel Falbel and Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-07-09-feature-columns</link>
      <description>TensorFlow feature columns provide useful functionality for preprocessing categorical data and chaining transformations, like bucketization or feature crossing. From R, we use them in popular "recipes" style, creating and subsequently refining a feature specification. In this post, we show how using feature specs frees cognitive resources and lets you focus on what you really want to accomplish. What's more, because of its elegance, feature-spec code reads nice and is fun to write as well.</description>

      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-06-25-dynamic_linear_models_tfprobability</link>
      <description>Previous posts featuring tfprobability - the R interface to TensorFlow Probability - have focused on enhancements to deep neural networks (e.g., introducing Bayesian uncertainty estimates) and fitting hierarchical models with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. This time, we show how to fit time series using dynamic linear models (DLMs), yielding posterior predictive forecasts as well as the smoothed and filtered estimates from the Kálmán filter.</description>

      <title>Adding uncertainty estimates to Keras models with tfprobability</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-06-05-uncertainty-estimates-tfprobability</link>
      <description>As of today, there is no mainstream road to obtaining uncertainty estimates from neural networks. All that can be said is that, normally, approaches tend to be Bayesian in spirit, involving some way of putting a prior over model weights. This holds true as well for the method presented in this post: We show how to use tfprobability, the R interface to TensorFlow Probability, to add uncertainty estimates to a Keras model in an elegant and conceptually plausible way.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical partial pooling, continued: Varying slopes models with TensorFlow Probability</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-05-24-varying-slopes</link>
      <description>This post builds on our recent introduction to multi-level modeling with tfprobability, the R wrapper to TensorFlow Probability. We show how to pool not just mean values ("intercepts"), but also relationships ("slopes"), thus enabling models to learn from data in an even broader way. Again, we use an example from Richard McElreath's "Statistical Rethinking"; the terminology as well as the way we present this topic are largely owed to this book.</description>

      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-05-06-tadpoles-on-tensorflow</link>
      <description>This post is a first introduction to MCMC modeling with tfprobability, the R interface to TensorFlow Probability (TFP). Our example is a multi-level model describing tadpole mortality, which may be known to the reader from Richard McElreath's wonderful "Statistical Rethinking".</description>

      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-04-24-autoregressive-flows</link>
      <description>Continuing from the recent introduction to bijectors in TensorFlow Probability (TFP), this post brings autoregressivity to the table. Using TFP through the new R package tfprobability, we look at the implementation of masked autoregressive flows (MAF) and put them to use on two different datasets.</description>

      <title>Audio classification with Keras: Looking closer at the non-deep learning parts</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-02-07-audio-background</link>
      <description>Sometimes, deep learning is seen - and welcomed - as a way to avoid laborious preprocessing of data. However, there are cases where preprocessing of sorts does not only help improve prediction, but constitutes a fascinating topic in itself. One such case is audio classification. In this post, we build on a previous post on this blog, this time focusing on explaining some of the non-deep learning background. We then link the concepts explained to updated for near-future releases TensorFlow code.</description>

      <title>Discrete Representation Learning with VQ-VAE and TensorFlow Probability</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2019-01-24-vq-vae</link>
      <description>Mostly when thinking of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), we picture the prior as an isotropic Gaussian. But this is by no means a necessity. The Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) described in van den Oord et al's "Neural Discrete Representation Learning" features a discrete latent space that allows to learn impressively concise latent representations. In this post, we combine elements of Keras, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Probability to see if we can generate convincing letters resembling those in Kuzushiji-MNIST.</description>

      <description>TensorFlow Probability offers a vast range of functionality ranging from distributions over probabilistic network layers to probabilistic inference. It works seamlessly with core TensorFlow and (TensorFlow) Keras. In this post, we provide a short introduction to the distributions layer and then, use it for sampling and calculating probabilities in a Variational Autoencoder.</description>

      <title>Concepts in object detection</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2018-12-18-object-detection-concepts</link>
      <description>As shown in a previous post, naming and locating a single object in an image is a task that may be approached in a straightforward way. This is not the same with general object detection, though - naming and locating several objects at once, with no prior information about how many objects are supposed to be detected.
In this post, we explain the steps involved in coding a basic single-shot object detector: Not unlike SSD (Single-shot Multibox Detector), but simplified and designed not for best performance, but comprehensibility.</description>

      <title>You sure? A Bayesian approach to obtaining uncertainty estimates from neural networks</title>
      <dc:creator>Sigrid Keydana</dc:creator>
      <link>https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/posts/2018-11-12-uncertainty_estimates_dropout</link>
      <description>In deep learning, there is no obvious way of obtaining uncertainty estimates. In 2016, Gal and Ghahramani proposed a method that is both theoretically grounded and practical: use dropout at test time. In this post, we introduce a refined version of this method (Gal et al. 2017) that has the network itself learn how uncertain it is.</description>

      <description>Like GANs, variational autoencoders (VAEs) are often used to generate images. However, VAEs add an additional promise: namely, to model an underlying latent space. Here, we first look at a typical implementation that maximizes the evidence lower bound. Then, we compare it to one of the more recent competitors, MMD-VAE, from the Info-VAE (information maximizing VAE) family.</description>
